# NeuraVeil Userscript

NeuraVeil is an AI chat panel, lightweight and modern, that integrates naturally on any webpage.

It uses the open (no-signup) APIs of [Pollinations.ai](https://github.com/pollinations/pollinations) for text and image generation, in order to provide immediate access to an AI directly during your browsing.

No need to change pages.  
No heavy interface.  
No account.

Just a simple, fast, and clean chat, usable on a daily basis.
